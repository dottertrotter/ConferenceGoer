Conference Goer is template hybrid app that conferences can use to provide their attendees with relevant information.

Styling is kept to a minimum in order to allow for easy branding.

To try out the app simply run a python webserver in the demo-data directory by running:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open the .workspace file in XCode and Run the project.
